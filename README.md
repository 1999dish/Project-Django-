My awesome Home is a e-commerce website that allow user and companies to interact. The project is made using HTML,CSS, and Django.
It includes concepts from django like template inheritance,model registration, user authentication and validation and the data is stored in sqlite 3 provided by django. 
The database sqllite3 helps to retrive data related easily and django was superfun to do the project.
The project include HTML,CSS but the main motive is to lean django.
The most difficult part of the project was how to show up items added to our admin panel for that i added a for loop can be looked in index.html and creating search system.
I was really wondering how to change login to logout once a user logged in thaanks to django documentation and stackoverflow .
Django admin is a super coool system it makes the authenticatrion very useful as it is already built in.
 the main files here basic.html-> which basicly includes the layout where each page has to look same on visiting
